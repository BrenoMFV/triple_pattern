# Observers

The SSP segments the state into 3 reactive parts, the state value (state), the error object (error), and the state loading action (loading).

These segments are observed in a listener or separate listeners. They can also be combined to obtain a new segment, always starting from the 3 main segments.

### Observers {#-observers}

We can observe the segments separately or together by using **store.observer()**;

```dart

//Observer all segments
var _dispose = counter.observer(
    onState: (state) => print(state),//called when the state changes
    onError: (error) => print(error),//called when the error changes
    onLoading: (loading) => print(loading),//called when the loading changes
);


_dispose(); //cancel the observer

```

On Widgets we can observe on a Builder with ScopedBuilder or observe all changes with TripleBuilder.

### Dispose {#-dispose}

The observer returns a function that can be called to cancel the observation.


### Distinct {#-distinct}

By default, the Store's observer does not react to repeated objects. This behavior is beneficial as it avoids state reconstructions and notifications if the segment has not been changed.

It is good practice to overwrite the **operation==** of the state value and error. A good tip is also to use the package [equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable) to simplify this type of comparison.

### Selectors {#-selectors}

We can recover the reactivity of the segments individually for transformations or combinations. We have then 3 selectors that can be retrieved as Store properties: **store.selectState**, **store.selectError** and **store.selectLoading**.

The type of selectors changes depending on the reactive tool you are using in the Stores. For example, if you are using **StreamStore** then your selectors will be Streams, however,  if you are using **NotifierStore** then your selectors will be ValueListenable;

```dart

RxValueListenable<int> myState$ = counter.selectState;
RxValueListenable<dynamic> myError$ = counter.selectError;
RxValueListenable<bool> myLoading$ = counter.selectLoading;

```

## Listeners {#-listeners}

The listeners are used to listen to the segments and react to them. They are called when there is any change in the segments.

### TripleListener {#-triplelistener}

Use TripleListener to listen all segment modifications and reflect them in the listener callback.

Exemple:
```dart
//Observer all segments
TripleListener(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    listener: (context, triple) => print(triple.state),//called when any segment changes
    child: Container(), //the child to be built
),
```

### ScopedListener {#-scopedlistener}

Use ScopedListener to listen all segment modifications and reflect them in the recpective segment listener callbacks.

Exemple:
```dart
//Observer all segments
ScopedListener(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    onState: (context, state) => print(state),//called when the state changes
    onError: (context, error) => print(error.toString()),//called when the error changes
    onLoading: (context, isLoading) => print(isLoading),//called when the loading changes
    child: Container()//the child to be built
),
```
## Builders {#-builders}

The builders are used to listen to the segments and react to them. They are called when there is any change in the segments.

### ScopedBuilder {#-scopedbuilder}

Use **ScopedBuilder** to listen the segments, likewise the method **store.observer()**;

```dart
//Observer all segments
ScopedBuilder(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    onState: (context, state) => Text('$state'),//called when the state changes
    onError: (context, error) => Text(error.toString()),//called when the error changes
    onLoading: (context) => CircularProgressIndicator(),//called when the loading changes
);
```

### ScopedBuilder.transition {#-scopedbuildertransition}

Use it for adding a custom transition on state change:

```dart
//Observer all segments
ScopedBuilder.transition(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    transition: (_, child) {//called when the state changes
    return AnimatedSwitcher(//add a custom transition
        duration: Duration(milliseconds: 400),
        child: child,//the child to be built
      );
    },
    onLoading: (_) => Text('Loading...'),//called when the loading changes
    onState: (_, state) => Text('$state'),//called when the state changes
  ),
```
### TripleBuilder {#-triplebuilder}

Use **TripleBuilder** to listen all segment modifications and reflect them in the Widgets tree.

```dart
//Observer all segments
TripleBuilder(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    builder: (context, triple) => Text('${triple.state}'),//called when any segment changes
);
```

> **NOTE**: The **TripleBuilder** builder is called when there is any change in the segments. Its use is recommended only if you are interested in listening to all segments at the same time.

## Consumer {#-consumer}

The consumer is used to listen to the segments and react to them. They are called when there is any change in the segments.

### TripleConsumer {#-tripleconsumer}

Use TripleConsumer to listen all segment modifications and reflect them in the Widgets tree and listener callback.

Exemple:
```dart
//Observer all segments
TripleConsumer(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    listener: (context, triple) => print(triple.state),//called when any segment changes
    builder: (context, triple) => Text('${triple.state}'),//called when any segment changes
),
```

### ScopedConsumer {#-scopedconsumer}

Use ScopedConsumer to listen all segment modifications and reflect them in the recpective segment Widgets tree and listener callbacks.

Exemple:
```dart
//Observer all segments
ScopedConsumer(
    store: counter,//the store to be observed
    onStateListener: (context, state) => print(state),//called when the state changes
    onErrorListener: (context, error) => print(error.toString()),//called when the error changes
    onLoadingListener: (context, isLoading) => print(isLoading),//called when the loading changes
    onState: (context, state) => Text('${triple.state}'),//called when the state changes
    onError: (context, error) => Text('${triple.state}',//called when the error changes
    onLoading: (context, isLoading) => Text('${triple.state}',//called when the loading changes
),
```


> **NOTE**: On ScopedBuilder the **onLoading** is only called on "true". This means that if the state is modified or an error is added, the widget to be built will be the **onState** or **onError**. However, it is very important to change Loading to "false" when the loading action is completed. **observers** of Triple *DO NOT PROPAGATE REPEATED OBJECTS* (more on this in the section **distinct**). This behavior is exclusive to ScopedBuilder.
