# What is Triple?

Triple is a nickname to SSP (Segmented State Standard).
Some packages were created to make it easier for developers to start using the standard. We'll call it an extension.

## Extension (Dart)

As we have seen, the purpose of the Segmented State Standard (Triple) is to help normalizing state management logic. We are working on abstractions (packages) based on reactivities developed by the community and Flutter natives ones such as ValueNotifier and Streams.

- [triple](https://pub.dev/packages/triple) (Abstraction to Dart)
- [flutter_triple](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_triple) (Implements **triple** building Stores based on Stream and ValueNotifier)
- [mobx_triple](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx_triple) (MobXStore)
