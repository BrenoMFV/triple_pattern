<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## :memo: About The Project

Triple is a nickname to SSP (Segmented State Standard). Some packages were created to make it easier for developers to start using the standard. We'll call it an extension.
### Extension (Dart)
As we have seen, the purpose of the Segmented State Standard (Triple) is to help normalizing state management logic. We are working on abstractions (packages) based on reactivities developed by the community and Flutter natives ones such as ValueNotifier and Streams.
* <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/triple">triple</a> (Abstraction to Dart)  
* <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_triple">flutter_triple</a> (Implements triple building Stores based on Stream and ValueNotifier)
* <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/mobx_triple">mobx_triple</a> (MobXStore)

<br>

## ‚ú® Usage

The SSP segments the state into 3 reactive parts, the state value (state), the error object (error), and the state loading action (loading).

These segments are observed in a listener or separate listeners. They can also be combined to obtain a new segment, always starting from the 3 main segments.

### Installation

Add to your project's pubspec.yaml.

```dart
...
dependencies:
  flutter_triple: any
...
```
